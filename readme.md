# AQA Computer Science A-Level Coursework

## About The Project
This music bot was created as part of the AQA Computer Science NEA (Non-Exam Assessment), taking just over a year. The purpose of the project was to create a music bot that was both functional, but also put more of an emphasis on the importance of the music, including features such as recommendations and more detailed song information for those that have a particular interest. It had been a longstanding personal goal to create a music bot on Discord, ever since using one when I first joined the platform, and I had failed previously 2 years prior on my first attempt as the playback proved unreliable and I didn't have the technical knowledge required. The code in the repository here is what I handed in for grading, scoring a total of 74/75 marks. 

### See It In Action
As part of the project, a testing video was produced to demonstrate how the bot works. You can find this video on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOe6lZorTwg)! To try out the bot youself, see the repository linked below!

### Further Developments
The project has since been maintained and further developed as a passion project for myself, evolving considerably since 2022. You can see the continued progress, as well as the original commits for this project, [here](https://github.com/SamLolo/Alto).
